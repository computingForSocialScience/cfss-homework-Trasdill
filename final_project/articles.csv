Acute coronary ischemia is the predominating precipitant, and prompt delivery of patients to dedicated facilities may improve outcomes. Since 2011, all patients experiencing OOHCA in London, where a cardiac etiology is suspected, are systematically brought to heart attack centers (HACs). We determined the predictors for survival and favorable functional outcomes in this setting. We analyzed 174 consecutive patients experiencing OOHCA from 2011 to 2013 brought to Harefield Hospital—a designated HAC in London. We analyzed (1) all-cause mortality and (2) functional status using a modified Rankin scale (mRS 0 to 6, where mRS0-3+ = favorable functional status). The overall survival rates were 66.7% (30 days) and 62.1% (1 year); and 54.5% had mRS0-3+ at discharge. Patients with mRS0-3+ had reduced mortality compared to mRS0-3−: 30 days (1.2% vs 72.2%, p &lt;0.001) and 1 year (5.3% vs 77.2%, p &lt;0.001). Multivariate analyses identified lower patient comorbidity, absence of cardiogenic shock, bystander CPR, ventricular tachycardia/ventricullar fibrillation as initial rhythm, shorter duration of resuscitation, prehospital advanced airway, absence of adrenaline and inotrope use, and intra-aortic balloon pump use as predictors of mRS0-3+. Consistent predictors of increased mortality were the presence of cardiogenic shock, advanced airway use, increased duration of resuscitation, and absence of therapeutic hypothermia. A streamlined delivery of patients experiencing OOHCA to dedicated facilities is associated with improved functional status and survival. Our study supports the standardization of care for such patients with the widespread adoption of HACs."

The early recognition of risk factors and event symptoms allows for the mitigation of disability or death. We sought to compare subject knowledge of stroke and MI, assess subject risk for cardiovascular disease, and determine if an association exists between knowledge and risk.MethodsIn this cross-sectional survey, adult, non–health care professionals were presented with a written knowledge test and risk assessment tool. Subjects were classified into 3 categories of cardiovascular risk. Associations were then calculated between knowledge, risk, and population demographics.ResultsOf 500 subjects approached, 364 were enrolled. The subjects were mostly white, middle-aged, and high school educated. Gender and income were evenly distributed. Forty-eight (14%) subjects were identified as ideal risk, 130 (38%) as low risk, and 168 (49%) as moderate/high risk. MI and stroke knowledge scores decreased as cardiovascular risk increased (85%, 79%, and 73% for ideal, low, and moderate/high risk groups, respectively; P &lt; .001). In addition, regardless of risk category, stroke knowledge scores were always lower than heart attack knowledge scores.ConclusionsKnowledge about stroke and MI was modest, with knowledge of MI exceeding that of stroke at every level of risk. Subjects with higher risk were less knowledgeable about the stroke signs, symptoms, and risk factors than those of MI."

Huge mud slides in the mountains destroyed houses, and heavy rains caused severe flooding in the inhabited areas. We investigated the incidence of cardiovascular events after the disaster.MethodsWe investigated patients who were admitted to the emergency department (ED) from July 12 to August 31 in 2012. We reviewed all patients with cardiovascular events, including acute myocardial infarction (AMI), angina attack, worsening of congestive heart failure (CHF), cardiopulmonary arrest (CPA), arrhythmias, tako-tsubo cardiomyopathy (TC), and symptomatic venous thromboembolism (VTE).ResultsThe total number of cardiovascular events was 28 (14 supraventricular arrhythmias, 3 angina attacks, 1 AMI, 1 VTE, 4 CHF, 1 TC and 4 CPA). There was a significant increase in cardiovascular events during the follow-up period in 2012 in comparison with the average number of these events over the same time period during the prior 2 years (16.8 vs. 5.1/month, p&lt;0.01). There was a sharp increase in cardiovascular events in the first week after the disaster. A second peak was observed 7 weeks after the disaster. Two patients with angina attack were previously diagnosed as having vasospastic angina. The incidence rate of AMI did not increase.ConclusionAn increase in cardiovascular events was observed after severe rainfalls and mud slides. Prevention of disaster-induced cardiovascular events should be a priority regardless of the magnitude of the disaster."

Those who survived tended to be younger, to have had a witnessed arrest in a public place with an initial cardiac rhythm of VF/VT, and to have been transported to the specialist centre more quickly than those who did not.ConclusionA system allowing ambulance clinicians to autonomously convey OHCA STEMI patients who achieve a return of spontaneous circulation directly to a Heart Attack Centre is highly effective and yields excellent survival outcomes."
[u'Williams, Paul T.', u'Thompson, Paul D.'], (2014-09-30) , "Increased Cardiovascular Disease Mortality Associated With Excessive Exercise in Heart Attack Survivors " , Mayo Clinic Proceedings , (Journal) , 89 , 9 , 1187-1194 , "AbstractObjectiveTo test whether greater exercise is associated with progressively lower mortality after a cardiac event.Patients and MethodsWe used Cox proportional hazard analyses to examine mortality vs estimated energy expended by running or walking measured as metabolic equivalents (3.5 mL O2/kg per min per day or metabolic equivalent of task-h/d [MET-h/d]) in 2377 self-identified heart attack survivors, where 1 MET-h/d is the energy equivalent of running 1 km/d. Mortality surveillance via the National Death Index included January 1991 through December 2008.ResultsA total of 526 deaths occurred during an average prospective follow-up of 10.4 years, 376 (71.5%) of which were related to cardiovascular disease (CVD) (International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision codes I00-I99). CVD-related mortality compared with the lowest exercise group decreased by 21% for 1.07 to 1.8 MET-h/d of running or walking (P=.11), 24% for 1.8 to 3.6 MET-h/d (P=.04), 50% for 3.6 to 5.4 MET-h/d (P=.001), and 63% for 5.4 to 7.2 MET-h/d (P&lt;.001) but decreased only 12% for ≥7.2 MET-h/d (P=.68). These data represent a 15% average risk reduction per MET-h/d for CVD-related mortality through 7.2 MET-h/d (P&lt;.001) and a 2.6-fold risk increase above 7.2 MET-h/d (P=.009). Relative to the risk reduction at 7.2 MET-h/d, the risk for ≥7.2 MET-h/d increased 3.2-fold (P=.006) for all ischemic heart disease (IHD)–related mortalities but was not significantly increased for non–IHD-CVD, arrhythmia-related CVD, or non–CVD-related mortalities.ConclusionRunning or walking decreases CVD mortality risk progressively at most levels of exercise in patients after a cardiac event, but the benefit of exercise on CVD mortality and IHD deaths is attenuated at the highest levels of exercise (running: above 7.1 km/d or walking briskly: 10.7 km/d)."
