I conducted three studies which showed that women will abdicate the opportunity to support highly or moderately qualified female candidates as potential work group peers. Furthermore, the concern that a highly qualified female candidate will be seen as more of a valued group member (competitive threat) and that a moderately qualified female candidate will adversely affect their value by reinforcing negative stereotypes about their demographic category (collective threat) partially mediated the relationship between numerical representation and work group prestige and women\u2019s preference for other women as work group peers.",

As a result, the objective of this paper is to define an ontology that leverages the availability of an individual things (object) identification information within the context of a standard set of economic phenomena that support multiple views in a range of data architectures.Our design science approach begins with a set of ontological primitives and gradually defines structuring principles that provide guidance for the design of supply chain systems that are characterized by increased visibility and interoperability and which facilitate management of and collaborative decision making about supply chain activities. The EAGLET ontology is named after its five primitives: Event, AGent, Location, Equipment, and Thing. The following are some of its unique characteristics: location and equipment are recognized as ontological primitives, and creating and destroying of containment structures is explicitly modeled; the economic phenomena underlying the supply chain are defined from an independent view, as opposed to a trading-partner view; the supply chain is defined from three different perspectives: the physical flow, the chain of custody, and the chain of ownership; event sequences that resemble the economic scripts underlying the supply chain are defined.",

The adoption of the protocol depends on its relative advantage, and the cost\u2013benefit associated with the use of the protocol is a significant factor affecting a protocol adoption decision. This paper aims at deepening the understanding of the cost\u2013benefits of CoAP and identifies the application scenarios where its use is likely to be economically justifiable. The paper analyzes the costs of using CoAP and HTTP in the Web of Things (WoT) applications, by identifying the components of the total cost of ownership (TCO) model for these applications and by studying the factors affecting individual costs. The use of the model is then demonstrated by means of comparing the TCO of CoAP and HTTP in an environment monitoring application scenario. The results of the analysis suggest that the simpler hardware requirements of CoAP smart objects, as well as the lower communication overhead of the protocol and the resulting reduced power consumption lead to cost advantages in the application scenarios where the smart objects i) are large in volume and/or are deployed in the field, ii) engage in frequent communications with the Web that are charged for on the basis of the volume of the data being transferred, and iii) are sleeping between the communication sessions. The obtained results may be utilized both by the decision-makers considering the adoption of CoAP in specific solutions, as well as by the academics and practitioners involved in the protocol development.",

            "DESCRIPTION": "AbstractAnimals communicate with each other via varieties of signal modalities such as visual, acoustic, semiochemicals, gestural, or communication behavior. Although animal communication has been studied as a signaler-receiver dyadic system until recently, it is actually a complex network due to the ubiquitous existence of third-party receivers in their signaling space, such as eavesdroppers, bystanders, and audiences. A question of fundamental importance in both science and humanity is whether or not animal signals are honest or deceitful (i.e., communication reliability) since it may shed light on the study of trust and altruism in human beings. The objective of this paper is twofold. First, the state-of-the-art research in animal communication (dyadic paradigm) and animal communication networks (network paradigm) and their potential inspiration for secure, resilient and pervasive computing are reviewed. Secondly, by arguing that competition, cooperation and communication are the three fundamental elements that natural selection acts upon in the evolution of organisms, and by comparing the study of cooperation (such as formulated as the Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma (PD) game), with the study of animal communication (such as formulated with Sir Philip Sydney (SPS) game), it is suggested that the latter field may spawn important cross-disciplinary research with the potential influence similar to or beyond that generated by the PD game research. The paper also summarizes the recent extension to evolutionary game theory (EGT) with survival analysis and dynamic hybrid fault models by the author. Finally, seven open questions, with regard to animal communication inspired computing and communication, primarily from the interdisciplinary perspective are posed. As a side note, this is the second article of a two-part series in which I review the state-of-the-art research in behavior biology inspired computing and communication. Given the extensive scope of behavior biology, I only focus on two fields most relevant to computing and communication animal cognition (part one, Ma, 2014) and communication (this article).

            "DESCRIPTION": "Associations in mixed-species foraging groups are common in animals, yet have rarely been explored in the context of collective behaviour. Despite many investigations into the social and ecological conditions under which individuals should form groups, we still know little about the specific behavioural rules that individuals adopt in these contexts, or whether these can be generalized to heterospecifics. Here, we studied collective behaviour in flocks in a community of five species of woodland passerine birds. We adopted an automated data collection protocol, involving visits by RFID-tagged birds to feeding stations equipped with antennae, over two winters, recording 91\u2008576 feeding events by 1904 individuals. We demonstrated highly synchronized feeding behaviour within patches, with birds moving towards areas of the patch with the largest proportion of the flock. Using a model of collective decision making, we then explored the underlying decision rule birds may be using when foraging in mixed-species flocks. The model tested whether birds used a different decision rule for conspecifics and heterospecifics, and whether the rules used by individuals of different species varied. We found that species differed in their response to the distribution of conspecifics and heterospecifics across foraging patches. However, simulating decisions using the different rules, which reproduced our data well, suggested that the outcome of using different decision rules by each species resulted in qualitatively similar overall patterns of movement. It is possible that the decision rules each species uses may be adjusted to variation in mean species abundance in order for individuals to maintain the same overall flock-level response. This is likely to be important for maintaining coordinated behaviour across species, and to result in quick and adaptive flock responses to food resources that are patchily distributed in space and time.",

The development of land use change models is challenging, as there is a need to connect representations of human behavioural processes to simulations of the biophysical environment. This paper presents a new agent-based modelling framework (Aporia) that has the goal of reducing the complexity and difficulty of constructing high-fidelity land use models. Building on earlier conceptual developments for modelling land use change and the provision of ecosystem services, Aporia was designed to be modular, flexible and open, using a declarative, compositional approach to create complex models from subcomponents. The framework can be tightly or loosely coupled with multiple vegetation models, it can be set up to evaluate a range of ecosystem service indicators, and it can be calibrated for a range of different landscape-scale case studies and modelling styles. The framework is released under an Open Source licence, and can be freely re-used and modified to form the basis of new models. We illustrate this with two case studies implemented using Aporia, exploring different socio-economic scenarios and behavioural characteristics on the land use decisions of Swiss and Scottish farmers. We also discuss the benefits of frameworks in terms of their flexibility, expandability, verification and transparency.",

Catastrophe models are probabilistic models based upon sets of events representing the hazard and weights their likelihood with the impact of such an event happening which is then used to estimate future financial losses. These probabilistic loss estimates often underpin re-insurance transactions. Modelled loss estimates can vary significantly, because of the assumptions used within the models. A rudimentary insurance-style catastrophe model for groundwater flooding has been created by linking seven individual components together. Each component is linked to the next using an open modelling framework (i.e. an implementation of OpenMI). Finally, we discuss how a flexible model integration methodology, such as described in this paper, facilitates a better understanding of the assumptions used within the catastrophe model by enabling the interchange of model components created using different, yet appropriate, assumptions.",

This is useful for hydraulic modelling in data scarce flood plain areas, where sharp elevation differences are dominated by man-made elevated elements.
